    "## Overview\n",
    "This command let users interact with UDB (User Database). It is distributed, hash-based, in memory database. \n",
    "It is designed to process vast amount of data in a computing cluster, where each node is responsible for unique set of primary keys in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows users to perform much more complex analysis and queries than `aq_pp` command could alone, on larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "`aq_udb` is used to perform data cleaning and transforming with UDB once the database is created. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of UDB\n",
    "* Database: User database, that contains one or more of the following components\n",
    "* Table: similar to TABLE in MySQL, with schema that is a variant of column spec\n",
