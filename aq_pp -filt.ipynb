    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective of this notebook is to educate and familiarize new users of `aq_tool` with `-filt` option. By the end of this sample, they should have understandings of basic syntax and usage of the option, and be able to perform basic operation comfortably. \n",
    "Advanced application, such as usage with other options will be covered in the future. \n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "`-filt` option of `aq_pp` command filter / select records (row) based on given conditional statement, which is called `FilterSpec` in `aq_tool`'s eco system. If given `FilterSpec` for a record is true, the record is selected. Otherwise it is discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as python pandas' equivalent of `df.loc[\"someCondition\"]` or SQL's equivalent of `WHERE` clause.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```aq_pp, -f,  ... -filt 'FiltSpec' ...```\n",

    "where `FiltSpec` is the conditional expression. Note that `FilterSpec` needs to be single quoted.\n",

    "* Column / Variable name, **without quotation**\n",
    "* String, number or IP address constant. (String needs to be quoted)\n",

    "`compare`: comparison operator, which are\n",
    "* `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` - comparison.\n",

    "\n",

    "**Example of Filter Spec**<br>\n",

    "Assume that we had an integer column named `age` with people's age, and we'd like to filter out records with age greater than 18 (exclusive). We can use this option as \n",
