I had over 25,000 lifetime coins and the counter only said it had a little over 1,000 coins.  I could not buy any of the other characters  required to pass the objectives.  It is still a fun game, but it was not working for me.  I have the regular temple run game and it works fine.  I would still recommend it, as long as it will work for your device. A few of the games that I have gotten on my tablet have not always worked correctly, but my battery was just running low when I downloaded them, so that was probably what did it.  I hope you will enjoy your game.	2015-03-24

It notes your errors and repeats them in the same lesson to ensure that you get it. Also, the segmented sections represent a good progression in learning and covers a variety of topics interspersed with some basic grammar. I would highly recommend for beginners. Good to have a dictionary or translator close by even though it seems like cheating but it's not if you commit to studying the vocab and idioms on your own after and re-testing yourself as you move further along. Worth the price ...FREE.	2014-10-02

It's cute and addictive. it's about timing - once you press the button and knowing when to let go of the button so that granny can land on her feet or get her cane to hook onto the next bar or wire so she can still pass or get further ahead of the thief. IMO it's most important to get helmets for granny so she recovers from a bad landing faster. You're trying to get as many coins as possible along the way and also land high points for a great landing after she jumps. As long as you finish one scene you can move onto the next one. Right now I'm stuck on &#34;Underground&#34;. Hopefully, I can get through this one soon.	2013-10-13

Der gravierendste Nachteil ist das Display fÃ¼r die Anzeige der Uhrzeit, dies ist viel zu klein und auch fÃ¼r Adleraugen erst bei genauem Schauen erkennbar. Die Reflektion der Uhrzeit an die Wand kann nicht auf Dauer eingestellt werden. Die Bedienung ist zwar nach mehrmaligem Lesen der Anleitung stÃ¶rungsfrei mÃ¶glich, fÃ¼r Star Wars Fans unter 12 Jahren dÃ¼rfte es jedoch mit einigen Schwierigkeiten verbunden sein. SchlieÃlich hat der Wecker nach dem ersten Batteriewechsel schon seinen Geist aufgegeben ohne dass er heruntergefallen wÃ¤re oder Ã¤hnliches aushalten musste.  Ein glatter Fehlkauf und somit nicht weiter zu empfehlen.	2011-10-10
UK	32652486	R2W2UZW4VWGREA	B0073LWEXK	993544388	The Lost City	Mobile_Apps	5.0	8.0	11.0	N	Y	Good for its genre	This is a good puzzle/point and click game. Very pretty, with an interesting method of changing the environment to reveal and solve new puzzles. It has no character interaction, so no stilted dialogue to cringe over! Nonetheless it makes up for a lack of characters by its puzzles, some of which require a very good memory for where the clues are. I probably got around 3 or 4 hours play out of it, but I play these things relatively quickly.<br /><br />A very good example of its genre, and an exceptionally pretty one too.	2012-11-18

Endlich mal wieder ein Spiel in dem es nicht darum geht StÃ¤dte zu bauen, oder Fahrstrecken oder Getreibe zu ernten. Das Spiel Kann man einfach mal spielen und muss nicht groÃe strategische Planungen vornehmen bei jedem Spielzug. Man braucht einfach GlÃ¼ck, denn auch wenn man sich als erster fÃ¼hlt kann sich am Ende alles noch ganz plÃ¶tzlich in eine andere Richtung drehen.<br />Es macht wirklich SpaÃ das Spiel in einer groÃen Runde zu spielen, zumal ein Durchgang auch nicht sonderlich lange dauert.<br />Die QualitÃ¤t des Spiel, also Figuren, Spielfeld und Verpackung sind sehr gut. Die Beschreibung liest sich ganz verstÃ¤ndlich, aber man braucht doch 1-2 Proberunden bis man es dann wirklich verstanden hat unweit wie man seinem GlÃ¼ck wÃ¤hrend des Spiel etwas auf die SprÃ¼nge helfen kann.<br />Das ist eine echte Kaufempfehlung, voranzutreiben dem Preis fÃ¼r den es zur Zeit gehandelt wird.	2015-01-18

I have 74 Aerosmith tracks on my Mp3 player.  At their best, Perry's licks and Tyler's raunch trump even Jagger and Richards.<br /><br />\\""Music From Another Dimension!\\"" would be a great album if it were cut down to LP size.  \\""Out Go the Lights\\"" and \\""Street Jesus\\"" fit in nicely with the best of their rest.<br /><br />We need Aerosmith - and the Stones - to give us those sloppy blues riffs with attitude to remind us of why we love rock and roll.  Aerosmith is still genuine and even relevant, but only for 30-40 minutes instead of the hour they give us.  Pick your favorite tracks and you have another solid album."	2013-01-04

Schon ZweijÃ¤hrige kÃ¶nnen hierbei Farben und Obstsorten benennen lernen und das WÃ¼rfeln und Sortieren des Holzobstes sorgt fÃ¼r Training der Feinmotorik. Eine Spielrunde dauert nicht lÃ¤nger als 15 Minuten, so bleiben die Kinder konzentriert.  Wer gerne spielt und sich darauf freut, es mit den eigenen kleinen Kindern zu beginnen, liegt bei diesem Spiel richtig.

DE	27591003	R2LMM2UTDBVY6Z	B00000IUT7	579461658	Brio 33223 - Rote Lola Batterielok	Toys	4.0	1.0	1.0	N	N	im Vergleich: super Lok auch fÃ¼r kleine Kinder	"Ich hatte fÃ¼r Weihnachten alle Elektrolokomotiven mit ihen Rezensionen auf Amazon angeschaut und schlieÃlich die \\""Rote Lola\\"" und eine Eichhorn-Lok (\\""4 Wheel-Drive\\"") bestellt fÃ¼r meine beiden TÃ¶chter (2+4J). Auch wenn ich die Eichhorn-Lok optisch sehr schÃ¶n finde, habe ich letztendlich nochmal einen \\""grÃ¼nen Gustav\\"" nachbestellt (Hinweis: \\""rote Lola\\"" und \\""grÃ¼ner Gustav\\"" sind identisch, nur farblich anders), weil mich die Lok Ã¼berzeugt hat und wir schlieÃlich 2 Loks (fÃ¼r 2 Kinder) brauchen.     Hier meine Bewertung:  - die Lok benÃ¶tigt 2 AAA-BBatterien (nicht dabei), die unter Verwendung eines kleinen Kreuz-Schraubenziehers schnell eingebaut werden kÃ¶nnen  - oben auf der Lock sind 3 DruckknÃ¶pfe (die gelben Kamine) fÃ¼r vorwÃ¤rts/stop/rÃ¼ckwÃ¤rts und auÃerdem ein Umschalter (auch gelb) fÃ¼r Elektro-Betrieb oder selber-Schieben, alles sehr leicht zu bedienen, auch fÃ¼r meine 2 jÃ¤hrige Tochter  - beim Losfahren ertÃ¶nen die Dampflock-typischen GerÃ¤usche, sehr angenehm ist, dass diese aber eben nur beim Anfahren ertÃ¶nen, und dies in einer angenehmen LautstÃ¤rke und schÃ¶n anzuhÃ¶ren   - die Lok schafft ca. 4-5 Waggons Ã¼ber eine BrÃ¼cke zu ziehen, dann rutschen die Gummireifen der AntriebsrÃ¤der durch (was ich aufgrund einer Vor-Rezension schon wusste und dann auch sofort mit ganz wenig Patex klebte), geklebt schafft sie locker alle Steigungen mit beliebig vielen AnhÃ¤ngern  - das Licht ist ganz nett, aber nicht wirklich nÃ¶tig, da wir nicht im Dunkeln spielen  - aufgrund der LÃ¤nge der Lock schafft sie z.B. 2 unmittelbar hintereinander gebaute BrÃ¼cken (Berg, dann Tal und sofort wieder Berg) nicht, da sie dazwischen zu wenig Platz hat und hÃ¤ngen bleibt. Aber dann bauen wir halt Lok-gerecht um...     Fazit (im Vergleich zu der Eichhorn-Lok):  1. die Eichhornlok hat seperat die GerÃ¤usche, die lauter und manchmal unangenehm langdauernd sind, d.h. man muss dafÃ¼r einen Extraknopf (oben drauf) drÃ¼cken um die GerÃ¤usche zu hÃ¶ren  > ich finde die GerÃ¤uscheder \\""Roten Lola\\"" angenehmer und viel praktischer beim Losfahren  2. die Eichhornlok hat zum VorwÃ¤rts/Stop/RÃ¼ckwÃ¤rts-fahren einen Schieber inmitten der Lok, den man zwischen der rechten und linken Lokseite hin undherschieben muss. Meine 2jÃ¤hrige Tochte konnte nie die Mittelposition finden und brachte die Lok dann immer frustriert zu mir oder lieÃ sie einfach angeschaltet liegen  > die KnÃ¶pfe der \\""Roten Lola\\"" sind logisch angeordnet und super zu bedienen, auch schon fÃ¼r ganz kleine Kinder (deshalb haben wir schlieÃlich noch den grÃ¼nen Gustav dazu gekauft und die Eichhornlok gehÃ¶rt jetzt mir ;))  3. die Eichhornlok benÃ¶tigt 1 AAA-Batterie fÃ¼r den Fahrbetrieb (nicht mitgeliefert), der Austauschmechanismus ist der gleiche wie bei der Roten Lola. Die Batterie war recht schnell leer, wohl auch dadurch, dass meine Tochter die Lok alleine nicht ausschalten konnte  > rote Lola mit 2 Batterien etwas angenehmer von der Batterielaufzeit, sonst gleichwertig  4. die Eichhornlok hat 2 AntriebsrÃ¤der, wodurch die Zugleistung sehr gut ist, vor allem in schwierigen Situationen (steiler Berg,...), nach dem Kleben der RÃ¤der bei der \\""Lola\\"" ist kaum ein Unterschied festzustellen, auÃer dass die lange Schnauze der \\""Roten Lola\\"" selten etwas hinderlich ist und die Bahnstrecke dann angepasst werden muss  5. von der Geschwindigkeit sind sich die Loks ebenbÃ¼rtig, ich finde es eine angenehme kindgerechte Geschwindigkeit (nicht so schnell wie die Merklin-Eisenbahnen), schÃ¶n zum damit Spielen  6. zur Haltbarkeit kann ich noch nicht viel sagen, bisher leben noch alle 3 Loks (gerade mal 1 Monat jetzt, aber tÃ¤glich bespielt)"	2011-01-15

So I am always excited when a new one is released and I can surprise her with more Dr. Panda.<br /><br />This game is great, there aren't that many houses (only about 5) and they seem to repeat in the same order (not randomly like previous Dr. Panda games) but my daughter doesn't mind that at all, in fact I think she enjoys the repetitive game play and predictability, it allows her to get better and better at the games. She loves collecting the virtual stickers for her sticker collection (something that has been lacking in Dr. Panda games since the Hospital game). I love how the Dr. Panda games really allow my daughter to be creative and artistic while also honing her motor skills and getting her familiar with a touchscreen device.<br /><br />Now for a few complaints. All of my complaints are of a technical/programming nature. My daughter is playing this game on an HP Touchpad running Android ICS. First, after certain mini-games Dr. Panda will hold his hand up for a high-five, except during certain mini-games he will flicker during his animation and be invisible while expecting a high-five. The game will not progress until you tap his hand, you have to tap where his hand should be and the game continues, however some children might not be able to figure out that they need to high-five a Dr. Panda that they can not see. Second issue is the broken door mini-game. When we first downloaded the game, the door fixing mini-game would bot show any of the rest of the house whenever the hammer hit the door, everything except for the door and the hammer would turn a dark navy blue for a second while the animation of the piece of door falling would play. However during our second time loading the game, and every time since, as soon as the hammer is about to hit the door the game crashes and closes. I have tried force stopping the app and even rebooting my device, but no matter what we can no longer play that mini-game, so now we have to simply skip the house with the broken door and leaky shower. The only thing I haven't tried is uninstalling and re-installing the app, but my daughter doesn't want to lose her collected stickers. So for the time being we'll have to skip fixing that house.<br /><br />In short, I love the game and the Dr. Panda series as a whole, but I wish some of the technical problems in this game were resolved. I'm not sure if it is simply my device, or a result of poor programming, but perhaps an update/patch could be released to address these issues in the future.	2013-06-17

Lady Gaga you are truly amazing with your digital partnerships! I cannot believe how much I have been hearing about this highly anticipated album with partnerships with Google Chrome, Zynga, and now Amazon.  This is a great promotion as to create urgency with people buying the album instead of downloading it for free somewhere.  I was going to purchase her album at Target like I usually do with new albums because they usually have a deal for $9.99 or something along those lines but I mean you cannot beat less than a buck.     Granted it took a couple hours to download but its because I was on a wireless network.  It went faster with some people with a better connection.     Also the great thing is that you do get a digital cover- a PDF with 14 pages about the songs, etc.  This is better than the actual  CD because when I buy the CD all I do is go on my computer, rip it onto iTunes and transfer it on my iPod so this just takes one less step and for 90% cheaper! Thanks Gaga and Amazon!	2011-05-23

The pages are well thought out with nicely spaced lines, hours of the day on the left (so you can write in appointments etc), there's also space at the bottom for weather conditions. I'm using my diary for a mix of planning appointments as well as a diary, filling in empty space with the days activities and thoughts. It has to be said that there is only just enough space to do this!<br /><br />Other features of the diary are the standard Moleskine fair, an annual overview of international holidays, a pull out address book, and contact details in the front page in case you lose it etc.<br /><br />My final thoughts / conclusion is that when 2014 comes round, I'm not sure if I will stick with the people daily diary, or go back to the weekly planner booklet.	2013-01-05

I've always had a bit of a love/hate thing with Muse. Their albums are always packed with excellent tracks, but somehow one or two stinkers always seem to find their way in there. This time the quality to stink ratio is pretty good, with all the tracks being strong except for track 12 (Unsustainable), which is, to my ears, by far the worst thing Muse have ever done. It's abysmal, painful to listen to, completely lacking any kind of melody or musical sense, and to be frank, sounds like a dial up modem going wrong.<br /><br />Oh and the absurdly overblown Olympics song is rather dodgy too, but compared to track 11, it's a masterpiece.	2012-10-01

No one likes an ugly game, no matter how good the gameplay.  But they haven't skimped on the gameplay either.  The game is fun and not too complicated to learn.  I haven't played it enough to get into complex strategy, but I can tell that the more one plays, the more interesting it will be to play as players learn better strategies.  Finally, I played with my father, who hates board and card type games.  I had to cajole him into the first game, but he has actually initiated several games since then.  So, all in all I can say that it is fun to play, easy to learn, and visually stimulating.<br /><br />There are only two (mildly) negative things I have to say about the game.  First, I wish they had included more wooden action markers.  One of the variables of gameplay is that you get an extra action, but because there are only two action markers per player, another marker would have been nice.  Not a hard problem to solve at all, though, I just use one of the spare gray cutout pieces.  The other thing is that this game probably doesn't appeal so much to hardcore gamers, as I suspect it will turn out to be a little too simple, with not enough variables for people who game a lot.  However, for beginners or younger players, it's an excellent game, and for more experienced gamers, it is cute and good for a few games or games with less game-inclined friends.  Not least of all because no one doesn't want to play a game with pandas!  Overall, I would say it's an excellent addition to any game collection.	2013-09-04
US	32497244	RSFFU285ACX2X	B0097GVJWQ	863325730	Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek	Mobile_Apps	4.0	0.0	1.0	N	Y	Up a Creek in Maple Creek	&#34;Enigmatis: Ghosts of Maple Creek&#34; from Big Fish Games is a sprawling large scale adventure game with a good story line that will please fans of the genre. Although the game itself isn't too difficult for experienced players, once they get the hang of some unusual aspects of the game play, it's designed to take quite a while to solve completely.<br /><br />The player assumes the role of a female private detective who develops amnesia when her car crashes upon arrival in the town of Maple Creek. At first, she doesn't even know who or where she is but she gradually pieces together that she was sent to find a girl who disappeared. The more she investigates, the more she realizes that the disappearance wasn't isolated. Instead other people have been vanishing in the small town for decades, including another private eye who went there some 30 years earlier on a similar mission.<br /><br />While &#34;Maple Creek&#34; has a complicated and well thought out storyline, the game play itself is fairly standard for those familiar with adventure games in gneral. The player moves around the town, picking up useful items and then using them. For example, if the player finds a knife, then there's a good chance, she'll need to cut something with it later. Fortunately, items don't stay in inventory any longer than they are needed, so players won't wind up with 30 to 40 items as the game goes along.<br /><br />âMaple Creekâ has a number of hidden object mini-puzzles. A number of locations have areas where there's a lot of junk lying around. When that area of the location glows, then it's time to click on the glowing area and play the hidden object game. Once the player finds all the hidden objects, one of them turns out to be useful and is added to inventory. The player can enlarge the playing area to make the hidden objects easier to find. The game also has some mini-puzzles to be solved, which involve things like finding out the combination or password to open a lock.<br /><br />As the player progresses through the game, the detective writes down notes in her notebook as she figures things out. For players who put the game away for a while, reading through the notebook can help them refresh their memory. In addition, there's also a bulletin board (actually a wall in one of the rooms) where the detective can pin up clues that she discovers during the game. It's actually essential in order to finish the game that the player actually pins up all the clues in the right place on the bulletin board. Until she does so, she often can't make any more progress getting through the game.<br /><br />For those who get stumped, âMaple Creekâ has a hint button. Press the hint button and an area in that location may light up, indicating the player should look there. If the particular location has no more areas of interest, the exit arrow lights up instead. The hint button can also reveal the location of one or more of the hidden objects in a hidden object game. The game also has a skip button that allows the player to bypass a puzzle.<br /><br />âMaple Creekâ only has one annoying feature. Some of the hidden object puzzle games can't be played until certain points in the game, even if you discover and click on the area where the hidden object puzzle is located. As a result, a player may have to go through the entire game, screen by screen (and there's about 30 total screens in the game), until she finds the next hidden object puzzle and can progress any further. Some of the cluttered areas have three or four hidden object puzzles that can only be accessed at different stages of the game.<br /><br />The fact that the game requires constant back tracking throughout every location in the game gets to be a bit of annoyance, since, in many cases, there's no way to logically figure out where to go next. Instead, players must resort to trial and error several times during the game to figure out the next step in completing the game. That necessaryrandom backtracking makes the game play longer and can be a bit frustrating.<br /><br />Technically, the game looks good with clean, easy to recognize artwork and audio that includes the voices of the various characters the player encounters during the game. Some of the objects that must be found aren't that easy to recognize, but I enjoy a game that makes me do some of the work in trying to figure out just which of the objects I encounter actually play a role in the game.<br /><br />Although I would have liked &#34;Maple Creek&#34; better if it didn't require occasional random wandering about in order to solve, the overall excellent story line and game play make the game enjoyable despite the occasional frustration. For those who aren't as proficient at these types of games, the hints and skip features allow players to get assistance as often as needed. In addition, once players buy the complete game, that's it as far as paying money. Players do not have to buy hints or spend money in other ways in order to finish the game. Instead, they will get hours worth of game play. Obviously, this type of game is not everyone's forte. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy adventure puzzle games, &#34;Maple Creek&#34; is one of the better examples.ating.

The Tablet itself comes with the pen already charged ( I got the Li-Ion Version) , and getting the whole operation up and running took less than 30 minutes from box opening to drawing.  Very pleased.<br /><br />As for the drawing experience itself, I have no problems with tracking and accuracy.  I mainly use it for doing quick sketches and calculations without paper, as well as AutoCAD / Inventor work (for which it is a godsend).  The programmable and totally custom buttons and hotkeys make workflow a breeze.  This is my first tablet of my own, though I have fooled around with some Wacom ones and honestly couldn't tell the difference, besides wacom does not require a battery in the pen.<br /><br />  If I lose 100 lines per inch and have to bear another 5g in pen weight to get larger real estate and save 40% of this products price, I will do it in a heartbeat, as well as recommend this heartily.	2015-08-25

"I was going to buy other cheap desk mounts because spending 124$ on Ergotron LX is too much for my budget. This is Neo-Flex is perfect price-wise and functionality-wise. But then I thought why don't I just buy cheaper desk mounts around 25$? I wasn't comfortable spending 124$ for a desk mount. Given the quality and mobility of this Neo-Flex, I'm happy I spent 67$ on this. Ergotron LX would be an overkill for 24\\"" LED slim screens (~10lbs). This arm is strong enough to support older, heavier 24\\"" LCD screens. This is more than what you need if you have a standard 24\\"" 1080p monitor. If you have a 27\\"" the only problem you may have is that you may not be able to use portrait mode so easily. It sure can support 27\\"" in landscape. If you have 27\\"" heavy monitor though, I'd recommend you get the LX. I thought about buying this or other desk mounts for at least three days because this mount didn't come in black. At last, I decided I'll get this mount anyway and spray a good black paint on it. Still researching a good spray &/or if I should sand it first or just leave it gray. I'd really love a black neoflex. FYI, I'm using this arm with ASUS VS248H-P 24\\"" 1080p monitor. It's a perfect combo. I feel like the mount is going to last for years."	2012-08-30

She enjoys that app so much that I paid for the daycare app (and I'm glad I did - being able to move around all the rooms does make a difference).  With that app as a sucess, I paid for the Hospital app since she loves the Doc McStuffins show.  This app is a little harder for her, so I've noticed that she will flip back to the Daycare one after 10-15 min....but can tell that in about 6 mths this will be more challenging for her than the daycare app...so it's worth the 1.99 cost	2013-02-04

To be honest the battery level issue that has been raised isnt a problem unless your'e a geek who warns to check his battery level every two minutes. The only issue I have, and it's a very slight one, is that the replacement battery pack has a little deformity which means a bit of it rubs on the mat surface, which, although it doesn't inhibit it's use, kind of annoys me....being an apple user, you just want perfection I suppose :)  For what it is I think this is an elegant solution to apples stupidly designed magic mouse design (just imagine how many millions of batteries are being thrown away every week as a result of Apple's irresponsible attitude to designing environmentally ethical products!), and I can't understand why Apple don't sell these in their stores.  A suggestion though, would be to release a version hat uses the mouse mat itself a a charging surface, perhaps this could also be used to charge the wireless keyboard ?? Now THAT would be a good idea !!	2013-01-16

Because the keyboard moves around, it difficult to know where middle c is and so if you don't know notes by ear, its not a good tool to actually learn the notes. However if you have the songs on another learning aid, which there are some in the appstore, you can use those when you're ready to start playing on your piano at home. I haven't yet purchased the full version yet, but so far this seems to be one of the best games/tools out there like this.	2012-08-19

They were right...... Great game, with some real frustration, Times I was totally stumped and got very cross and fed up..... I had to close the game and come back later.... whereupon my patience and maybe a fresh eye I managed to see something I had missed or find the next move.<br />Graphics are amazing, the background sounds very spooky...... the clues proved invaluable at times, annoying at others.....<br /><br /> just a little niggle; on the couple of occasions that I was pleased to be progressing really well without using clues, I had made a couple of moves found what I needed to do... but couldn't progress because the clues were slower appearing than I had been and I had to wait for the clues to load before I could progress.<br /><br />In retrospect, I thought the last sections of the game perhaps appeared a little rushed.... like a good film that seems to have realised it's two thirds through and it has to reach a conclusion so the last chapters of the story get crammed in with less attention.....certainly I was a bit taken aback when I suddenly found I had reached the end of the game..... disappointed too........ I was engrossed...... now what am I going to do :(<br /><br />Highly recommend this game..... Where's the next one please.	2013-05-10

I admit I was first expecting to get to see 1, 2, or 3 stars, but working toward completing the territory is a good challenge. I have read other reviews stating there are achievements in levels 2 and beyond, but I haven't gotten there yet.<br /><br /> I like trying to defeat the enemy with only one boulder, but at least to me, this isn't easy. Maybe with practice, it will seem that way. The really good news is that it is challenging, but not impossible. If you don't get it perfect by using only one boulder, you can still go on to the next stage. There do not seem to be any negatives to using more than one boulder.<br /><br />The graphics are cute animations, except for the fact the king is spending the entire game swinging his tongue. My boys found this hilarious. I didn't really care one way or another. However, take a look at the pics to decide for yourself if you find it offensive for your own kids.<br /><br />I also appreciate the lack of intrusive permissions. App developers need to know we want more games like this.<br /><br />The only real problem is that I didn't find an EXIT button. If it is in the game, it is well hidden, or at least, not intuitive. I had to use the Android button to exit on my Kindle Fire HD.	2013-11-14

That being said, I like how he has grown out of his 70's power rock phase and has settled down a bit. All in all, a great album and Billy seems to finally be comfortable with himself as a musician and has found like-minded individuals to help him create this music.	2012-08-14

US	41254991	ROSD1LMIPSOP6	B00FVVR2ZO	527249565	Alice in the Mirrors of Albion	Mobile_Apps	4.0	0.0	1.0	N	Y	New to Albion	Just started playing a couple days ago so this is a preliminary review.  Thus far I've enjoyed the graphics and the premise.  For folks who are intimately familiar with the Alice stories it may be slightly far afield, but I find the mix of Looking Glass references combined with an almost &amp;#34;Steampunk&amp;#34; vibe entertaining.  Really love the seasonal references for Halloween.<br />Starting out the game process is a bit confusing and the main screen becomes cluttered very quickly with all the challenge icons down one side and a host of additional icons on the other edge.  Energy seems to rebuild with moderate speed, but it would do game developers to pay attention when I say the more energy (time one can devote to playing) available to newbies the quicker they will become addicted.  This game definitely has addiction potential.<br />No problems yet playing on Kindle Fire, but guess I haven't reached a needed update yet.  Will let you know as game progresses.	2014-10-27

It runs Oracle Virtual Box Great.  No errors with Fedora 13.  I am having issues with ISO copies I made of Fedora 19 but I think that is corrupt data on the DVD from using am usb DVD drive on a laptop.  It is fast and efficient.  It comes with two physical cores and it turns into Four Logical Cores.  They are counting logical cores.  There are four threads on this machine.  In Device Manager it shows 4 cores. Despite that it is great. Don't crap on AMD.  The original benchmarks on this core favored Intel because it fully supported Intel technology.  This core is better than I3 don't let Intel junkies tell you otherwise. The integrated graphics good.  Pair it with another graphics card and you can get better.  You want something that beats I7 3770k without paying $219 buy AMD FX 8530 it is better than the i7 3770k.  Latest benchmarks for this cpu support this. I have had no trouble with this core the core runs fine. Update older monitors drivers to avoid flicker.	2013-11-13

Wir sind hier auf einem Niveau dass nur eine handvoll Bands je erreicht hat.<br />Ja, ich bin ein Corgan Fanatiker und deshalb vielleicht nicht objektiv, aber wer dieses Album verpasst, der verpasst nicht nur ein StÃ¼ck der Neunziger sondern, ja ich gehe wirklich so weit, ein StÃ¼ck Musikgeschichte.<br /><br />Wenn ich Lied rauspicken mÃ¼sste dann &#34;thru the eyes of ruby&#34;, vielleicht gar nicht das musikalisch beste StÃ¼ck auf diesem Album,  aber textlich im Kontext dieses Albums einfach ein SchÃ¤deldeckel sprengender Wahnsinn.<br /><br />Einfach kaufen, paar Whiskeys oder andere Rauschmittel in den Kopf reinschÃ¼tten und genieÃen....!	2014-06-24

Zwar w&auml;hren etwas mehr Quests und Ausr&uuml;stungsgegenst&auml;nde toll gewesen, dies k&ouml;nnte Crescent Moon Games allerdings noch mit einem Update nachholen.<br />Die Story ist okay und die Orte im gro&szlig;en und ganzen sch&ouml;n gemacht.<br />Was allerdings nicht so sch&ouml;n ist, sind die vielen Bugs! Da ist noch nachholbedarf!<br />Ich gebe Shadowlands 9\10 Punkten! Also klare Kaufempfehlung!	2013-05-31

The controls are easy to use, there are many things in this that are in real Minecraft, and you can go multiplayer! I rarely freezes and it is very simple and fun! I really suggest getting it even though the price is high. There are frequent updates making the app better in some way. This app does not have all of the animals in it that Minecraft PC does. For example, it does not have bats, horses, or bunnies. It does have monsters. You can not go to the End or the Nether. (At least I don't think the End).	2015-01-14

Ich ziehe einen Stern ab, da meiner Meinung nach in diesem Set die in vielen Foren gelobten Feather Klingen, sowie die Personnas fehlen.<br /><br />Beim Testen bin ich auf Folgende Rangfolge gekommen:<br />1) Astra gr&uuml;n<br />2) Astra blau / Dorco<br />3) Derby<br />...<br />100) beide Shark<br /><br />Die Shark Klingen sind meiner Meinung nach absolut gar nicht zu gebrauchen. Diese haben bei weitem die unsanfteste Rasur abgeliefert.<br /><br />Die Derby Klingen fand ich auch eher unangenehm, dies legte sich aber nach ein, zwei Rasuren ein wenig.<br /><br />Im Vergleich zu den bisher erw&auml;hnten Klingen sind die beiden Astras und die Dorco eine Klasse f&uuml;r sich. Diese waren ab der ersten Rasur direkt angenehm sanft. Die gr&uuml;ne Astra empfand ich aber noch ein kleines bisschen besser als die blaue Astra und die Dorco.<br /><br />Alle Klingen habe ich in einem Edwin Jagger DE86 getestet.	2015-06-04

However, for the longest time before I got my phone I couldn't enjoy it as much because Kindle Fire only recognizes 2 fingers. You can only play around with two fingers! It bugged me to DEATH until I got it on my phone. So yeah, not for Kindle Fire. Find out if your device has 10 or 5 point touch before buying.<br />  Oh, and guys?<br />  You don't have to listen to the music. You can turn it off. I never listen to the music and that doesn't take anything away. If you're really disappointed and want music that's relaxing, play Binaural Beats on Spotify or something. The app is amazing, especially when you just turn the music off.	2014-11-24

However you quickly realise the futility of the exercise. Only the top 1-2% of players actively participate in the real gameplay or strategy. Basically the powerfull players/cities in the kingdoms set the rules. The ordinary players must obey although them above respect them only when they see fit. For example no battles Monday till  Friday (no attack protocol) nap in game speak and no rules everyone attacks at weekend ffa (free for all). Not bad in principle. The problem is the powerfull just wipe the floor with everbody due to no system of ranking or seeding in batttles. So during ffa you either get annihilated or hide all weekend behind a protective peace shield which guess what will probably cost you real money. So during ffa you can't actually participate as a lesser mortal. The whole purpose of the game therefore becomes one of building the strength of your army and city during the week and hiding and surviving at the weekend. Step outside this rigid regime and you will be punished by the big players. Worse still your team mates will suffer so you have to comply. True there are events to compete in like the super wonder where you compete for dominance and titles. You can't enter though as you are not powerful enough. It is possible to reach the upper echelons of game play in Game of War only through the investment of considerable hours and even more serious money. I have heard rumour that one of the very top players spent half a million US dollars to get there. For the ordinary player which is the vast majority there is no purpose to this game. You simply survive and that quickly becomes boring.<br />Tushar.	2015-02-28

I love the assortment of games ... there's something for everyone.  Just about every type of mini game you can think of. I enjoy the puzzle games the most.  Once I got my kindle fire, I had to download the 101 games in HD, which look awesome.  I also have this app on my kindle fire, too.  Some of the games are on both apps, but there slightly different. The sushi one is the same, but it's harder on the HD app than on this one. Although it took me a while to meet the goal on this app, I can't even come close to the goal on the HD app, but it's ok because it just gives me something to work at.  I didn't read the 1-star reviews, but I'm assuming the people aren't into games if they're unwilling to play them to boost their money level to get more games. So-o-o-o many to choose from .... and there are ads???  I don't even notice them.	2014-03-06

I actually have to keep more than one going at a time because the kids grab the balls and run or they knock them away as they are flying around.<br /><br />Our Playskool Explore and Grow Busy Ball Popper is nine years old and still working and the Fisher-Price Go Baby Go! Poppity Pop Musical Dino is about a month old.  I haven't had any problems with these toys breaking and battery life has been splendid.<br /><br />The problem I do have is the balls get lost (or crammed in small holes) and they are expensive to replace ($20 for six here on Amazon).  I found a place online last year to order replacement balls from Playskool but you had to fax your order and they never responded to the fax.<br /><br />When I got this toy, I immediately searched their website for a way to order replacement balls and couldn't find one.  I emailed them and Fisher-Price replied with an email that sent me to their service page.  I followed the links to Stand-Up Ballcano and it states that no replacement parts are available.  But they do have replacement balls for Dino (search for \\""bag of balls\\"") that I thought would work.  The balls cost $5 for six + $5 s&h + tax.  I ordered four packs so I ended up paying about $1 a ball.  Fisher Price sent a followup survey to see if I was satisfied and I explained the action I had taken.  I received a call today from Fisher Price stating that the balls I had ordered would NOT work with Ballcano and that the Ballcano balls were $11 for a bag of 6.  I told them that was too high so they sent me a bag for free and cancelled the earlier order.<br /><br />I had been told that Fisher Price had great service and now have evidence of such.  I did request, however, that they come up with a uniform ball size."	2012-08-27

Jason Mraz's fifth, fresh acoustic album, &#34;Yes!&#34; is a wonderful wake-up call for every one of us to take action, to instill a sense of hope in humanity and to pursue a positive attitude, in spite of the challenges we face. The tracks continue to tell stories of acceptance, encouragement, lasting love, satisfaction and, ultimately, success. With Mr. A-Z being backed with the vivacious vocals of the folk-rock band, Raining Jane, the magical melodies and sincere song lyrics get your feet off the ground and running into opportunities otherwise thought impossible to accomplish. It is so difficult to come back to the Earth when this music is amrazingly out of this world.	2014-07-20

They appear to be molded out of kind of hard rubber or plastic and feel solid all the way through. This makes them heavier that you would expect. My daughter is very rough on her figures and these seem like they will last through years of small child abuse! The fine detail is very good and the colors are outstanding. I am not qualified to say if they are absolutely accurate but they look very realistic!<br /><br />The only minor issue may be with very young children and these figures. Since they are so solidly made you should be careful with children around the low end of the recommended age of 3. My daughter like to bang these around on her play table and a few times she has mashed her little fingers with these. If thrown or use to hit with these could be dangerous. Definitely keep these out of the hands of babies and small toddlers.	2014-01-09

Or maybe even 2 or 3 and so on. You can make houses with building materials like cobblestone, wood planks, stone, and gravel. U can also restore your hearts by killing animals and collecting its meat or making a recipe. Now in creative mode there is no monsters. You have all the supplies. Well, there is no animals either and u don't have lives. You have unlimited supplies. Oh ya, forgot to tell you in survival mode if you mix lava and water, you create cobblestone.<br /><br />This is a fun, fun, game. I recommended it to all.	2013-02-16

Effectivement le dÃ©but de l'album est sublime. Mais voilÃ , passÃ© les 4 ou 5 premiÃ¨res chansons, le soufflÃ© retombe vite et on se retrouve avec des morceaux plus consensuels, qui auraient pu Ãªtre chantÃ©s pour des ados prÃ©pubÃ¨res par Katy Perry. Bref on est loin du pop rock dÃ©lurÃ© qui a fait les belles heures de No Doubt. Au final, je ne sais pas si je le conseille ! La moitiÃ© de l'album est gÃ©niale, le reste un peu moins mais l'ensemble se laisse Ã©couter. Donc faites vous votre idÃ©e avec les extraits	2013-11-11

I would not pay over $15 if I had to do it all over again; overall, I'd say it's worth $10.  The zippers seem to be constructed well, but I wish the cardboard walls were stronger.  There is a fabric overlay covering the cardboard inside, but after only a few uses, my cardboard walls had bends/creases in them.  It still works just fine, but it's not a perfect cube anymore.  It's more like a cube that got smashed down, and my kids don't play super hard with their toys.  I don't think this would last long with a real &#34;rough player&#34;.  I love how big it is, though.  My daughter can fit 12 Barbies, 8 mini-Barbies, and all of her dresses and furniture in this!  I just wish it was sturdier.	2014-02-15

I enjoy word games, I have an expansive vocabulary, and I don't mind a challenge. However, many of the challenges in this game come not from the level of knowledge required, but from its mistakes.  Some of these errors are obvious and easily worked around: the clue suggests a noun, but the answer is in adjective form, or the word is obscure and/or archaic. Some of them arise from what I suspect is English not being the developer's native tongue. And some simply shouldn't exist in a final product: the word is separated, not seporated (this was a clue, so it didn't render anything impossible), along with several other spelling errors. Some clues are lifted directly from crossword puzzles, and indeed, if you go to one of the many crossword clue websites out there, you can find the answers.  Some clues are so poorly phrased that one simply has to solve them last by rearranging the letters left until the right order is found.<br />However, I still very much like the game, and if I'm honest I'm usually a bit of a vocabulary/grammar fussbudget. There is enough that's right to make it enjoyable...and it's possible that I get a perverse sense of accomplishment from figuring out the gaffes.  If you're a crossword purist, if you can't look at a puzzle wrong way round without going cross-eyed, or if mistakes drive you batty, you'll want to find a different game. Because this game *will* drive you nuts. But if you like that sort of thing, you might just have a good go.	2014-01-25

Firsty Im fed up of reviews already saying this is no 'this is it' or this is better than 'this is it'. I understand that we want to benchmark 'this is it' but essentially what im trying to say is this is an entirely new album and should be appraised on its own merits.<br /><br />If you love the overall sound of the strokes this one will not disappoint i enjoyed everytrack on the first listen. Okay maybe you are not keen on the strokes and if that is the case this album still contains 4/5 potentially good singles and promotes the band in good light.<br /><br />I understand i have been very broad here but i really get fed up of pretentious reviews!<br /><br />here 8.5 out of 10	2011-03-24

Occasionally, her voice betrays her in that it sometimes lacks the timbre or range that will come naturally in the next few years. However, her musicianship is superb and she brings a unique touch to this great collection of jazz standards. Her orchestra and band are top notch. This is one of those rare debut albums that 20 years from now will be the foundation of what I expect will be a stellar discography. I really look forward to listening to her voice mature and musicianship develop in the coming years, we're all in for a real treat.	2010-05-06

"I like a few of the songs, but not completely in love with it as I was with Twilight's soundtrack even the main movie's theme  song \\""meet me on the equinox\\"" doesn't capture the essence of this movie. I was hoping for something more heartfelt although still indie. I'm just not feeling it, the music is not conveying the heart-wrenching breakup  that Bella goes through. As others have mention is feels too monotone.  Who knows once the movie comes it might grow on me or at least that's what I'm hoping for. All in all not a bad purchase for $4.99.

I know this horse has been beaten to death, but it only took a short amount of listening to realize the differences.  But, before I get into it too far I just want to say that both models are excellent headphones; and it's amazing that either set can be had for less than $100.<br /><br />And a WARNING to all buyers.  Because these phones have been around forever, and because they are so popular (I think Sony sells more than 35,000 pairs of these a month) there are lots of fakes out there.  You can research this on the web, but the safest way to insure you are getting the real deal is to make sure that when you purchase here on Amazon you only buy when it says \\""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com\\"".  It is the easiest way to be sure you're getting the genuine article.<br /><br />Everybody hears differently, and everyone \\""listens\\"" differently.  We don't all enjoy the same types of music, and similarly, every set of headphones is not necessarily suited for every genre of music.  We all own different source components, and most of us have a limit as to what we are willing to spend on our gear.  I believe every headphone review should include a brief summary of the reviewer's musical tastes, sources, and gear and should always including references to other sets of cans they own, have auditioned, liked, or disliked.  With so many variables affecting peoples like or dislike of any pair of phones it is my goal to help those with similar musical tastes and similar gear to determine whether or not these headphones will be a good investment for them personally.<br /><br />To that end; I listen to music in practically every genre.  I tend to go through different phases, but I enjoy Mozart as much as Metallica, 80's one hit wonders and New Orleans Jazz, Lady Antebellum or Lady Gaga,Eminem to Zedd.  Music has so much to offer in all genres that one could spend a lifetime discovering new things they like.  I use my computer to play all the usual manner of digital files, and an Onkyo C-7030 CD player to handle disk duty.  Both feed into my Nuforce Icon DAC/Headphone Amp.  The digital files via USB and the CDs via analog RCA (the Onkyo has excellent onboard D/A conversion).  I have also been playing around with a Little Dot MK2 ii Vacuum Tube Amp (which I am really starting to love).  It should also be noted that I use no equalizer to modify the sound of my music (because I don't have one available in my setup).  My headphones include Sony MDR-V6s and these MDR-7506s, V-Moda Crossfade LPs and M-100s, Audio Technica ATH-M50s, Beyerdynamic DT-880 250ohm Premiums, Sennheiser HD 598s and HD 600s (my personal favorite) as well as my 4th pair of Koss Porta-Pros (easy to exchange when you live in Milwaukee) .  I've tried Grado SR 80s and SR 225s (just too darn uncomfortable), some Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250ohms (I prefered the DT 880s), and my son even owns a pair of first generation Beats Solo phones (Yuk).  The other day I threw away some Denon's (no clue what model, but circa 1990) and a set of Sony MDR-V600s that were both totally worn out.  I also own lots of buds as well (my Klipsh X10s being my favorite).<br /><br />Like I said at the beginning, these headphones sound great.  They are by far my favorite set of closed phones.  The crossfades are fun (they'll make your teeth chatter), but the sound is very unnatural.  The ATH-M50s sound excellent as well, but I prefer the Sony's more natural midrange.  I like them with most genre's of music, but I prefer them with classical, jazz, adult contemporary, jazz rock, and other similar genres of music.  The 7506's (and V6's) also give the widest soundstage of all my closed cans.  When comparing the sound to the V6's I would say this.  Both models have some of the most natural sounding mids I have heard ina headphone.  The V6s have more bass and noticeably higher highs, where the 7506's are flatter through the audible spectrum.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  It isn't hard to hear the difference, and you can see it as well by going to Headphone dot com's \\""build a graph\\"" page and comparing the two.  The build a graph is an excellent page and when I look at the graphs for the various phones I own it shows exactly what I'm hearing myself.  I have heard many reasons for the differences between the two sets of Sonys from wiring to cup shape, and I've read all the references to the parts list that says they have all the same pieces, but all I'll say again is that there is a difference.  If you like a flatter sound with less of a \\""smile curve\\"" then these 7506's are what you're looking for.  If you like a bit more bass and treble I'd recommend the V6's (though the highs can cause fatigue after a while).  If you are looking for cans to monitor or edit video then the 7506's are the ticket.  It's amazing how accurately they can playback the sound I record with my video camera, and it's no surprise that you see these on the heads of people in the movie business when you watch behind the scenes extras on DVD's and Blu-Rays.  I have taken the V6's to work and I use them with my little Nuforce uDAC-2 as the two pair together very well, and the 7506's are my go-to phones at home when open cans won't do.  The phones are very efficient as well.  They play plenty loud without a lot of power, though they sound even better with a nice amp.  They are also very revealing.  While you will hear lots of details in your music, you will also hear all of the flaws.  Music with accentuated highs may also sound shrill and sibilant when using these phones.  If you want lots of booming bass you'd be best to look elsewhere.  The 7506's have nice low, accurate, detailed bass, but they aren't thumpers by any means (nor are the V6's). If you want some serious thump on a budget watch for the V-Moda Crossfade LP's to go on sale (you will sacrifice detail and clarity, however).<br /><br />The build quality is excellent and I'm alright with the earpads wearing out and needing replacement from time to time (I'm on at least my 5th set in 2 decades with the V6's).  All earcups need to be replaced sooner or later, and if you shop around you can find the Sony replacements for a cheap price.  If you opt for some of the velour replacements that are out there you will (or you should) notice a change in the sound (I've tried them with the v6's).  It's also important to watch the foam part of the cups that covers the driver.  If it starts to break down it will get pushed into the holes in the front of the driver itself and it will ruin it (this is what happened to my V600's).  The phones are very light, the comfort is excellent, the clamping pressure is pretty light, and the sound isolation is really good too.  I also like the coiled cord and the quick change screw plug.  I have never had an issue with my cord on my V6's in almost 20 years and I don't foresee a problem with the 7506's.  The carry bag is handy and surprisingly durable as well.  I do wish they locked in a little tighter when you opened them as they often seem to want to close back up while trying to put them on.  You also have to be careful for the right side wire as it can get pinched in the whole works and possibly become crimped.<br /><br />You just can't go wrong with The 7506's or the V6's at the price they sell for.  You just have to decide which response curve you prefer."	2014-08-09

This game is fun to play, I enjoy it a lot, it's almost addicting, as I'm sure it is intended to be.  But, it is not free, far from it.  I just got into the India adventure (46) and it took me at least 30 attempts before I got close to winning, but to complete it I had to by an extra minute.  The different format in the India game, the little squiggly symbols are difficult to match.  This I think is also done to make it take longer to complete the game.  The worst part(s) though are the prices charged to buy the diamonds, and how much is charged for an extra minute of play time and to shuffle, so to say this is free is hardly the case.

A word of warning though, if you have an additive personality like I do you may not be able to put it down and walk away. I always think that I can beat my previous time!<br />For those who are complaining about frequent locking up, I may have solved the issue.  Originally,  I downloaded the free version and found that it would lock up on me in levels 6-10 requiring a hard reboot of my Kindle.  I purchased the paid app and downloaded it but did not uninstall the free app. I have yet to have it lock up on me, even in the upper levels.<br />My only complaint is that your scores earned on the free app do not transfer to the paid app.	2012-09-22

I say this with sadness in my heart because I was really hoping that this was the solution I was looking for. I had plans to be able to sit on my couch and use my flat screen with my MBP.<br /><br />Let me explain...<br /><br />The idea is a great one, but the problem is the click functionality of the Magic trackpad base, it does not work when sitting in the Clique. Or rather it works once and then is stuck in that position. Maybe I am missing something, like a set of instructions that address this issue, but sadly there were none in the wonderful packaging that this item came in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, looks are not able to overcome this design flaw and I will be returning said item unless I can get a major assist from the good people at Henge Docks.<br /><br />Changing to the tap function is not useful as the other functions change and dragging and dropping is easiest with the click feature of the trackpad. Love the trackpad the way it is, why should I change my habits to conform to a poorly designed product.... Work-arounds are not what most people are looking for, and being up front would hurt sales. This is not an expensive item and most people will not return because it is inconvenient. I don't have a vendetta against the Henge Docks, but I do read reviews when shopping and like them to be accurate.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT based on the review of someone that works for the company with cheery things to say about everything the company does, especially when the reviewer discredits the other reviewers that have had real experiences that were less than rosy.<br /><br />Just keeping things real, I wanted to love this product but it did not live up to expectations	2012-03-19

Great sounding headphones and very comfortable.  Bought these to replace my Sony V6's of 10 years (broken due to my nephew sitting on them), which were still in great shape.  So, $150 was my maximum amount that I was willing to spend on a pair of headphones for home, since I already have my pair of Shure e5's for when I'm out-and-about.  I decided on these after reading a whole bunch of reviews and after trying out several headphones (Sony V6's/MDR-V900's, Sennheiser HD-280's, Bose Triports), but the K240 stood out as the clear winner for me, even next to the more expensive K271's.  The headphones are extremely comfortable and were made even more so when I added a set of Nice Cans headphone covers (the stock pleather ones got a little sweaty and sticky when I wore them for more than an hour).  The suspension system is pure genius taking the weight and tension off the ears and putting it on the top of my head, even after wearing for 4 or more hours.  Also, if the cord ever get's destroyed or develops a short, it can be replaced by unplugging the existing one and putting a new one on.  As a matter of fact, each individual part can be bought from AKG and replaced if one wears out (which I highly doubt).  All in all, after a month of use, these have completely left the V6's in the history books.  As time goes on and the drivers loosen up even more, the sound gets better and better!  They do need a little time to sound as good as their potential, like my Shure's, so have a little patience.  I would recommend these phones to anyone, especially if using an ipod or any other low power audio device.  Great phones and enjoy!	2007-12-24

In addition, depending on what order you execute them, you get different results.  For example, if you take the sine of 90 deg., the calculator properly returns an answer of 1.  If you immediately follow that with the cosine of 90, you properly get 0.  Take the sine of 90 again and this time, the calculator gives an answer of 0.<br /><br />There are more instances of this than I can recount but the basic takeaway is that for anything except the most basic operations, this calculator is essentially useless.  This applies to the Kindle Fire HD, and resetting the device did not help.	2012-12-23

I enjoyed playing this game as it playes like a big fish/ G5 type game. It was long and worth the price. The lag time between scenes was definitely annoying but i dealt with it. Using the map helped when jumping from one scene to another. I would not have been able to stand the wait time between scenes without using the map feature. The hint system basically only told you what you could do on a particular scene. If there was nothing left to do in a room then thats all it said. There were no hints to tell you where you should go next. Not even the map feature showed available actions...This brought a challenge to the game that i rather enjoyed but would still have appreciated a more interactive map that gave a clue as to possible available actions. I found myself wandering around looking for what to do next and this was when the lag time annoyed me the most and bumps my rating of this game down to a 4. The HOS were not too hard / easy and i liked the item association twist to mix things up when having to revisit the same HOS. The puzzles were a challenge at times. I only needed to use the guide that was provided once or twice.	2015-02-22

It will also allow it to tilt at an angle for typing; however, only in one direction.  I have some apps which open only in one direction and it's the opposite direction of the tilt, so it can only be used on some, not all, websites and apps.<br /><br />In some apps in order to exit you must press the bar at the bottom, but the case covers the bar so you must pull the case away and press your finger or stylus inside.  Quite awkward.<br /><br />This case is so awkward, in fact, that I don't intend to keep my Fire in it.  I will only use it when I want to watch a video and need a stand.<br /><br />It has slots inside the cover to hold credit cards, but I would advise against that.  A lot of tablets are left on tables and in airplane pockets, so you wouldn't want to leave your credit or debit cards along with it.  You can slip paper notes into the sleeve inside the front pocket.  Although I don't know who's going to be writing notes when they have a tablet handy.<br /><br />What I would have liked to see is an elastic band inside the cover to hold a stylus, instead of credit card slots.<br /><br />In short, the designers could have done a much better job with this cover.  Some simple adjustments would have made it worth purchasing.	2012-04-30

You have different little animals and you have to try to make sure they are all holding hands. The different creatures have different qualities that make it more challenging to hook hands together.

US	28771661	R2COZP3Y6Z017K	B003VANOFY	623336330	Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound, Wireless Headphones with Microphone	PC	2.0	0.0	0.0	N	Y	The sound quality is pretty good for the price	The sound quality is pretty good for the price, but seeing as these are wireless headphones on the 2.4 GHz bandwidth, I'm constantly getting interference from common household products, like my microwave. At times, the sound will cut out completely for 5-10 seconds, then come back. It's incredibly annoying. I didn't figure out what the source of the problem was until AFTER my warranty had expired (of course) and after more than 10 hours of digging through Logitech forum threads of people complaining of similar issues with these headphones.<br /><br />I would suggest you buy a different brand of wireless headphones, or if you MUST buy Logitech, try to buy wired.	2015-07-03

Not perfect for rock, not good for hip hop, but for most other types of music, they bring out sound that I didn't know was even there.  People have also said they're small and, as a result, uncomfortable.  I didn't really think they were small, maybe for someone w/a larger than avg head.  They fit me fine and in my opinion, are really comfortable.      They aren't real compact and don't plan on wearing them around town, unless, of course, you like being 'that guy.'  That guy being the dude with ginormous headphones, shutting out the rest of the world.  On that note, they do block noise fantastically well.  You could almost use them to land a plane, if for some reason you found yourself needing to land a plane.  In any case, these headphones are probably best thought of as 'location headphones' rather than ones you would cruise around w/.  Happy listening.	2008-04-26

I really prefer the tangible quality of a CD because I'm a collector, but if it's $5 vs $10 or more I can do with the download. I'm old enough to remember seeing the Allman Brothers Band while all the original players were still living. Eat A Peach was so named from Duane's response to an interviewer's question: \\""How are you helping the revolution?\\"" Allman replied: \\""There ain't no revolution, only evolution, but every time I'm in Georgia I 'eat a peach' for peace.\\"" I hadn't listened to the album for a number of years (I owned it on vinyl only) and I am was pleasantly surprised at how fresh it still sounds all these years later. This album, and it's predecessors, are the Allman Brothers at their peak. All the tracks are good. If you like Southern rock, this album should be in your collection and on your play list."	2012-10-08

This game is a Bejeweled knock off and not even as fun. It is easily the best game ever designed to make you spend money on micro transactions. Even worse the company is shutting down other games that use the word Saga in the title. This company and this game should be avoided. These games, that are only fun if you spend money, are killing the potential for better games. I do play games with the option to spend some money. These games are still fun if i spend nothing or $50. These games are not going after games like Banner Saga for using the word Saga.	2014-01-30

Using it for movement made my thumb very sore--I went back to using the D-pad on my n52te, and for that reason only.

But anyway let's get to the mission.<br /><br />Okay like the movie your trying to defeat 15 robots, including Zeus, you gotta train by  doing free sparring, and stuff to upgrade your robot and buy new robots and stuff, it's like a real boxing torament but with robots, there are four worlds or what ever is, uw uw 2, wrb and wrb 2. It's really good get it than those lame games	2014-06-13

I'm using the headset with my MacBook Pro late 2011 and it synched up perfectly the first time I set it up. Battery life is excellent, I can use it for 6 - 8 + hours. Range is also good even with other Bluetooth devices in the same room along with wi-fi and laptops without any interference. It's great for Starcraft II and watching movies - volume control feature and mute buttons work great with my mac programs. The only downside I faced with the headset is that there is no current Logitech support or software installations for Apple computers  to activate  the voice changer functions and or surround sound feature.  The headphones sound exceptionally clear even in the default stereo mode and the noise canceling microphone will cancel out other conversations in the same room as me no problem and only focus on my voice.	2014-01-03

I've been using the app for a couple of years now, on Android devices (mostly a nexus tablet and a bunch of phones). I love the app. Best feature to me is the ability to highlight sections as &#34;notes&#34;, and then export those notes to a separate file or email. This allows me to keep the best parts of books i read, in a searchable format. This, on the android kindle app, is very painful to do. I feel this app is so much better than the android kindle app, not just for the notes feature. Moon is more customizable on every level, which makes it very user friendly once configured properly.	2015-02-08

A great feature is the cord disconnects form the headphones and can be replaced without soldering if damaged or a different length or style is desired. Closed ear styles may be better for DJ monitoring in extremely loud clubs, but these should work for even most DJ applications though they do not fold for transport.	2015-02-25

Though it doesn't entail much brainpower, it makes up for it in its ability to suck you in, to coerce you to play endlessly; the entertainment is high for those of us with simpler minds that were turned to mush originally by arcade games like \\""Pong\\"". It really is easy to lose track of time, caught in its web of mindless, pointless fun.<br />I'm giving it only 4/5 stars, primarily because I DESPISE the black-hole economics that forces you to wait to regenerate lives or fork over real cash to buy more lives or different boosts that help especially on more difficult levels. I'm a mush-minded fool who is relatively easily lured by money-hole games that suck up one's hard-earned cash like a kid sucking up the remnants of his milkshake, and games like this can be dangerous to one's wallet. I wish they'd either make the silly thing in CD or downloadable format, or at the VERY least let you buy perks in bulk. (For those simps like me who just can't resist occasionally...) I guess that'd drain their bottom line - mooooolah - a little too much, though.<br />Otherwise, love the game. Unfortunately!"	2014-01-24

I had played the game in my free time for about 3 weeks...I was almost finished and only had a few more things to do and it kept freezing up and having a lot of problems and so I had to uninstall and reinstall and I was furious because I had to completely play the game over again...and I had already spent weeks getting to that point. if they could fix the glitches it would be the best game EVER!!!

The only reason why I didn't give it a &#34;5&#34; is because the Bat-plane has a tendency to break, which can be pretty annoying when you're a kid and you're trying to play with it.

"When I upgraded to a new-model MacBook Pro I realized (after getting setup) that I would need an adapter to get it to work with my Dell 30\\"" display. The Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter is the ONLY adapter that will work, so despite the horrible reviews on Apple for the product, I bought one (at the hefty $100 price tag).<br /><br />The adapter works fine most of the time. I connect my monitor to my laptop every weekday morning when I get to my office, and most of the time it works well. About 1/3 of the time when I connect it flickers single pixels or the entire screen. I have to disconnect and reconnect up to 5 times to get it to work, and sometimes that doesn't even work and I have to restart the computer with the cables attached.<br /><br />I have to say, if there was another option out there I'd purchase it in a heartbeat... but if you have a 30\\"" display and a new model MacBook Pro I'm afraid you're stuck with this."	2009-11-07

I brought the box home for him to open, and he was so happy and excited and appreciative when he saw what was inside.  He'd been trying to convince me for weeks that LDrago Destroyer was the best Beyblade and that his collection wouldn't be complete without it.  He's having a lot of fun with it.<br /><br />Great quality, too.  This Beyblade doesn't look or feel cheap at all.  The metal part is smooth and has no rough edges, and it's strong, i.e., not thin or flimsy.  The Beyblade and the launcher arrived in tact and in perfect condition.	2012-08-01

There's a pause function if you're timing yourself on how quickly you get through the puzzle and get interrupted by something and you can exit the app and come back later to pick up the puzzle where you left off.  I'm very happy with this purchase.	2013-04-18

The 3rd change is they now have pay for enhancements, do you can now give them more money for a game you already own.  And lastly the game will just randomly close when try to go to a different menu.  What was a fun 5 star fun game has just become a hassle.  If you can get past all the problems, the game play is the same.	2012-11-19

I purchased this interface because my aging 2008 mac pro was getting a bit snippy about running my even older M-Audio 1814 Firewire interface. In fact, I think Avid stopped writing new drivers for that old M-Audio device about the time my mac was purchased. I wasn't thrilled to replace the old gal but I got over 10-15 years of near daily service out that thing. I was reluctant to try the Scarlet 2i2 but based on many excellent reviews and the Focusrite reputation, I thought this could work for me. And it did!<br /><br />Installation on my mac was dead simple. Open the box, remove the interface, plug in the USB cable and bingo! I was up and running. Logic Pro recognized the hardware without incident and I recorded a voice over project the next day. Comparative to my previous recordings, there was no audible difference. So I tempted fate, reduced my latency sample rate from 512 to 256 and changed my preferences to record at 196k/24bit. Amazing. Not a single pop or stammer. I'm not putting out a higher quality product with no discernible strain on my aging system.<br /><br />Tech heads will want to know that I'm running a 2008 mac pro early version with 3.0 processors and Yosemite installed. I have not yet used the included plugins with any regularity but my tests showed them to be excellent quality and easy to use. I am very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />If I could make any negative comment, it would be that I much prefer to have cable connections on the back on an interface. For a desk top unit, this helps keep the cables and clutter to a minimum on my desk.<br /><br />As a portable unit, this thing is perfect for a laptop based set up. It's compact and lightweight form factor make it easy to dump in a bag and carry to gigs. The pre-amps are excellent and the value is outstanding. I may buy a second one to dedicate to mobile recording...	2015-06-08

This was fun for a bit, until you realize it will take hundreds of plays to get through story mode.<br />The upgrades are nice, but expensive, and gaining money is slow. It took almost 90 'days' (game plays) until I could get 20% through the story line. When you do the math, it would take hundreds of plays to finish the story. And each game play is essentially just holding the accelerator for 2 to 3 minutes until you run out of gas.<br />The physics of the game are nice, and the car customizations are cool: but the timed advertisements, the repeated runs, the slow progress, and the lack of being able to do anything but hold an accelerator make this an overall loser of a game.	2015-05-30

The only bad things are like there's only one real animatronic. The rest are hallucinations. Otherwise it's great. If it's hard for you here's how to play. Play the audio to lure spring trap into different rooms. When he's in your vent, simply seal it. If the flashing red light comes press or click the Orange tab in the office. Then reboot the one that says err. Press map toggle to switch between the vents and cameras. Thanks for reading this. Scott you did well but I wish you made more animatronics in this one.

Play if you dare...but be prepared to spend major bucks.  One tip that I didn't know ahead of time is that MZ will provide incentive packs at the beginning for $5.....if you don't purchase a $99 pack....the packs will stay affordable. Once you buy a $99 pack...the low deals will cease to exist.	2015-01-14

Overall, the games are a great way to keep yourself or your children entertained while experiencing down time. As you unlock new games there are enough of a variety that you donât get bored of them and are fun for any age.  As an adult you may get tired of playing it, but letâs be honest these game are meant for the younger age bracket.	2012-04-07

So far I am satisfied with it however, the free software that they advertise as free has not been as easy to obtain. I jumped through all the hoops required for registration and sent all the required information, but as of yet I have not been sent the required redemption code that is necessary to obtain the download. It would seem to me that after sending repeated request and recieving no response they are counting on me to give up. The recording software does not come with the mixer, and it seems to me that behringer want's it to be as difficult as possible to aquire. The mixer seems to be a solid product, however, the software that had a major bearing on my purchasing decision does not seem to be as free and easy as behringer is so willing to advertise. If you purchase a behringer product, keep this in mind. customer service so far for me has been less than I had hoped for. Good luck.	2014-12-29

I am a fan of the magic mouse, and have always felt that the battery door is the single flaw, to hard to remove.

Mine always reports 38%, this might not bother most people, who would simply  use the mouse till it dies and then recharge it, or leave it on the charger all the time.

Let me start off by saying, like my title says, this is an absolutely awesome motherboard! This is also the 1st review I have EVER written for any product so please forgive me if I omit any useful info. (I will be more than happy to answer any questions in due time. I think part of the awesome experience I have had with this motherboard has been the customer tech service I have received from Gigabyte. This is my very 1st build from the ground up I am proud to say and they (Gigabyte) has been there to help me numerous times.<br /><br />My build consists of a [[ASIN:B0055QYKQO GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD3 AM3+ AMD 990FX SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX AMD Motherboard]], a [[ASIN:B005UBNKWO AMD FX 6100 6-Core Processor, 3.3 6 Socket AM3+ - FD6100WMGUSBX]], 2 [[ASIN:B0047ZGIUK Sapphire AMD Radeon HD 6850 1GB PCI-E Video Card (100315L)]] running in CrossFireX, [[ASIN:B004E0ZKLQ Corsair Memory Vengeance 16 Dual Channel Kit DDR3 1600 MHz 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9]], and a [[ASIN:B00654PTT2 Creative Sound Blaster Recon3D THX PCIE Fatal1ty Pro Sound Card SB1356]] all running in Windows 7 64-bit.<br /><br />The motherboard is made of high quality materials, well at least compared to my old Vista Gateway's mobo. The revision on the board is 1.1 with the F6 BIOS installed. You will need to install the F8 BIOS. Everything was recognized and installed smoothly. I only had to call Gigabyte to find out why I couldn't switch my RAM from 1333mhz to their native 1600mhz. The tech was able to walk me through the BIOS and change various RAM settings since the profile template for 1600mhz did not work. Again, kudos & much appreciation to the Gigabyte customer support.<br /><br />And finally, this thing overclocks like a champ. I was able to push (with stability mind you) my CPU up to 5 GHz! I have decided to leave it at 4.2 GHz as this is fast enough for me. Everything is kept nice and cool (under 50c under load) with the [[ASIN:B002G1YPH0 Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus 120mm Sleeve CPU Cooler, RR-B10-212P-G1]] handling my CPU, and the other four fans inside my [[ASIN:B004351H9G NZXT Guardian Black SECC Steel Chassis ATX Mid Tower Case 921RB-BL]] handle the rest.

That's a lot of fans, but they are like whisper quiet.<br /><br />All in all, I have had nothing but positive experiences with this product and the support staff. I couldn't reccommend this product highly enough., RR-B10-212P-G1]] handling my CPU, and the other four fans inside my [[ASIN:B004351H9G NZXT Guardian Black SECC Steel Chassis ATX Mid Tower Case 921RB-BL]] handle the rest.

I was unfamiliar with Ms. Jarosz until I had the distinct pleasure of seeing her perform live in Pittsburgh, opening for the legendary John Prine. I knew then that I was going to buy this album. It is every bit as good as I had hoped. Here's an odd thing, though; in her live performances, she &#34;attacks&#34; these songs with her vocals. Every bit the joy or pain of a given song just wails out to the walls through her amazing voice. The album is (thankfully, actually) more restrained. The songs are soothing and eloquent. I want to get her first two albums (both more conventional blue-grass, as I understand), but really, I look forward to where she goes from here. What an amazing album. I'm absolutely in awe of her talent as a singer-songwriter. She may have blue-grass roots, but she has ability that spans many genres. Seriously, if you like the samples, you will LOVE the album.	2014-08-28

Sleek, modern and beautiful. A few things that I miss about my previous launcher (ADW EX) is the ability to change the app drawer to how I like and more intuitive gesture options. Instead of having the categories on the side, I liked them on top,  so I could swipe left or right in the drawer to change categories. Also, it would be nice to have the option for a gesture to toggle the status bar instead of just showing it.	2015-07-10

FR	40016831	R36BQ1B0AEIN4O	B00631HASU	84212511	Sparkle HD	Mobile_Apps	5.0	15.0	15.0	N	Y	Une r&eacute;f&eacute;rence incontournable!	Ce zuma-like est sans doute le meilleur que vous pourrez trouver. Il ressemble aussi Ã  Atlantis Sky Patrol ou Ã  Puzzle Bubble pour ceux qui connaissent. Une colonne de boules apparaÃ®t Ã  l'Ã©cran de diffÃ©rentes couleurs et se dirige via un labyrinthe vers la sortie. Le but de jeu est de dÃ©truire toutes les vagues de boules avant qu'elles n'arrivent Ã  la sortie. Pour cela, vous disposez d'une machine contrÃ´lable Ã  360Â° qui vous permet de lancer des balles de diffÃ©rentes couleurs pour faire en sorte de placer 3 balles de mÃªme couleur cÃ´te Ã  cÃ´te ce qui les fait disparaÃ®tre. Pour vous aider, une multitude de bonus vous aident en fonction des enchaÃ®nement que vous faites (ralentissement, boule multicolore, destructeur, machine arriÃ¨re...). Des allumettes apportent un confort au bout d'un certain temps de jeu aussi.<br />Mais n'allez pas croire que vous aurez partie facile pour autant. Les chemins se divisent parfois et vous aurez donc deux vagues Ã  gÃ©rer en mÃªme temps. Et sur la fin, c'est mÃªme 3 vagues en mÃªme temps qui vous attendent Ã  un rythme nettement plus corsÃ© qui vous plongera vers une calvitie prÃ©coce Ã  force de vous arracher les cheveux!<br />Le jeu est terriblement addictif (je participe encore Ã  des rÃ©unions de sparkleurs anonymes un an et demi aprÃ¨s l'avoir fini!). Il est aussi trÃ¨s bien rÃ©alisÃ© et Ã  la jouabilitÃ© exemplaire. Cerise sur le gÃ¢teau: des dÃ©cors trÃ¨s beaux et une musique envoÃ»tante. Et comme s'il n'Ã©tait pas assez dur et assez long Ã  l'origine, les Ã©diteurs ont rajoutÃ© un mode challenge Ã  la difficultÃ© croissante et un mode survie oÃ¹ ils vous fera tenir le plus longtemps possible; de quoi lui offrir une longÃ©vitÃ© Ã  toute Ã©preuve! Un seul bÃ©mol, car il en faut bien un: le jeu est uniquement en anglais.<br />Bref, n'hÃ©sitez pas une seule seconde et foncez! Et on se retrouvera dans quelques mois aux rÃ©unions des sparkleurs anonymes...	2013-04-05
